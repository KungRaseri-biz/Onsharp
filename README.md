# Onsharp
Onsharp is a C# Wrapper for the [Onset Game](https://playonset.com/). It allows you to use C# as your scripting language for the server-side.

## In Development
Onsharp is still in development. If you want to help me, feel free to fork this repo and create a pull request.
We do have a roadmap, too. Here you can see our Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/59DIseBJ/onsharp

## Documentations
We take great care to provide good documentation so that the introduction, but also the work with Onsharp is as easy as possible for everyone. We are not perfect, but we try our best. Here you can find our documentations: https://onsharp.gitbook.io/docs/
