# Onsharp
Onsharp is a C# Wrapper for the [Onset Game](https://playonset.com/). It allows you to use C# as your scripting language for the server-side.

## In Development
Onsharp is still in development. If you want to help me, feel free to fork this repo and create a pull request.
We do have a roadmap, too. Here you can see our Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/59DIseBJ/onsharp
